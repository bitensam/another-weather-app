## **<span style="color:yellow">1. Step - Layout<span>**

I had started with an idea, then I had made some resarch in design websites.

I wanted to achieve a nice and clean modern look.

First I had made the nav section, and at the beginig I was struggling a lot with RWD and buggers. Then I have made the other data-like sections and fell it with dummy data.

## **<span style="color:yellow">2. Step - Pass data between components<span>**

The first problem I encountered was passing props to the parent component. I had to pass the value entered in the field from the Form component through the NavMenu, Navbar all the way to the App.

Props related to calling functions to close the mobile menu went in the opposite direction. I passed them from NavMenu to Form.

I also made my own custom hook and called it use Weather. It allows, depending on the state, to render appropriate components such as loading, error or the actual application component.

**tbc.**
